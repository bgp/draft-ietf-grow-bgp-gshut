            <t>This draft describes operational procedures aimed at reducing the

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                Routing changes in BGP can be caused by planned, maintenance
                operations. This document discusses operational procedures to be applied in
                order to reduce or eliminate losses of packets during the maintenance.
                These losses come from the transient lack of reachability during the BGP
                convergence following the shutdown of an eBGP peering session between two
                Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR).
            </t>
            <t>
                This document presents procedures for the cases where the
                forwarding plane is impacted by the maintenance, hence when
                the use of Graceful Restart does not apply.
            </t>
            <t>
                The procedures described in this document can be applied to reduce or
                avoid packet loss for outbound and inbound traffic flows initially
                forwarded along the peering link to be shut down.  These procedures
                trigger, in both involved ASes, rerouting to the alternate path, while
                allowing routers to keep using old paths until alternate ones are learned, installed
                in the RIB and in the FIB.
                This ensures that routers always have a valid route available during the
                convergence process.
            </t>
            <t>
                The goal of the document is to meet the requirements described in <xref target="RFC6198"/> at best, without changing the BGP protocol.
            </t>
            <t>
                Still, it explains why reserving a community value for the
                purpose of BGP session graceful shutdown would reduce the
                management overhead bound with the solution. It would also
                allow vendors to provide an automatic graceful shutdown
                mechanism that does not require any router reconfiguration at
                maintenance time.

            <t>
                Packets can be lost during a manual shutdown of an eBGP
                session for two reasons.
            </t>
            <t>
                First, routers involved in the convergence process can
                transiently lack of paths towards an affected prefix, and drop
                traffic destined to this prefix. This is because alternate
                paths can be hidden by nodes of an AS. This happens when the
                paths are not selected as best by the ASBR that receive them
                on an eBGP session, or by Route Reflectors that do not
                propagate them further in the iBGP topology because they do
                not select them as best.
            </t>
            <t>
                Second, within the AS, the FIB of routers can be transiently
                inconsistent during the BGP convergence and packets towards
                affected prefixes can loop and be dropped. Note that these
                loops only happen when ASBR-to-ASBR encapsulation is not used
                within the AS.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document only addresses the first reason.

                This section describes means for an ISP to reduce the
                transient loss of packets upon a manual shutdown of a BGP
                session.
            </t>
            <section title="Improving availability of alternate paths">
                <t>
                    All solutions that increase the availability of alternate
                    BGP paths at routers performing packet lookups in BGP tables such as
                    <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-best-external"/> and <xref target="RFC7911"/> help
                    in reducing the LoC bound with manual shutdown of eBGP
                    sessions.
                </t>
                <t>
                    One of such solutions increasing diversity in such a way that, at
                    any single step of the convergence process following the
                    eBGP session shutdown, a BGP router does not receive a
                    message withdrawing the only path it currently knows for a
                    given NLRI, allows for a simplified g-shut procedure.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Note that the LoC for the inbound traffic of the maintained router,
                    induced by a lack of alternate path propagation within the iBGP topology
                    of a neighboring AS is not under the control of the operator performing
                    the maintenance. The part of the procedure aimed at avoiding LoC for
                    incoming paths can thus be applied even if no LoC are expected for the
                    outgoing paths.

                    The goal of this procedure is to let the paths being shutdown visible,
                    but with a lower LOCAL_PREF value, while alternate paths spread through
                    the iBGP topology. Instead of withdrawing the path, routers of an AS will
                    keep on using it until they become aware of alternate paths.

                                attribute, this AS specific g-shut community will be
                                used to override other LOCAL_PREF preference changes.

                            from the resulting aggregate BGP route.  By doing so, the setting of the g-shut

                The g-shut procedure or the solutions improving the availability of alternate paths, do not change the fact that BGP convergence and the subsequent FIB updates are run independently on each router of the ASes.
                If the AS applying the solution does not rely on encapsulation to forward packets from the Ingress Border Router to the Egress Border Router, then transient forwarding loops and consequent packet losses can occur during the convergence process.

                We identify two potential causes for transient packet losses upon
                an eBGP link up event. The first one is local to the g-no-shut initiator,
                the second one is due to the BGP convergence following the injection of new
                best paths within the iBGP topology.

                    An ASBR that selects as best a path received over a newly
                    brought up eBGP session may transiently drop traffic. This can
                    typically happen when the nexthop attribute differs from the IP
                    address of the eBGP peer, and the receiving ASBR has not yet
                    resolved the MAC address associated with the IP address of that
                    "third party" nexthop.

                <t>
                    A BGP speaker implementation could avoid such losses by
                    ensuring that "third party" nexthops are resolved before
                    installing paths using these in the RIB.

                    If the link up event corresponds to an eBGP session that is being manually
                    brought up, over an already up multi-access link, then the
                    operator can ping third party nexthops that are expected to be
                    used before actually bringing the session up, or ping directed
                    broadcast the subnet IP address of the link. By proceeding like
                    this, the MAC addresses associated with these third party nexthops
                    will be resolved by the g-no-shut initiator.

                    A typical example for such transient unreachability for a given

                <t>
                    Let's consider 3 route reflectors RR1, RR2, RR3. There is a full mesh
                    of iBGP session between them.

                            1. RR1 is initially advertising the
                            current best path to the members of its iBGP RR
                            full-mesh. It propagated that path within its RR
                            full-mesh. RR2 knows only that path towards the prefix.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            2. RR3 receives a new best path originated by the "g-no-shut"
                            initiator, being one of its RR clients. RR3 selects it as best, and
                            propagates an UPDATE within its RR full-mesh, i.e., to RR1 and RR2.

                        <t>
                            3. RR1 receives that path, reruns its decision process,
                            and picks this new path as best. As a result, RR1 withdraws
                            its previously announced best-path on the iBGP sessions of its RR full-mesh.

                            4. If, for any reason, RR3 processes the withdraw
                            generated in step 3, before processing the update generated
                            in step 2, RR3 transiently suffers from unreachability for
                            the affected prefix.

                    previously advertised (iBGP) path to its non clients
                    (e.g. other RRs in a mesh of RR) when it receives a new,

                Applying the g-shut procedure is rendered much easier with the use of a
                single g-shut community value which could be used on all eBGP sessions, for
                both inbound and outbound signaling.  The community value 0xFFFF0000 has been
                assigned by IANA for this purpose.
            </t>
            <t>
                For Internet routes, a non transitive extended community will be reserved
                from the pool defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities"/>. Using such a community type allows
                for not leaking graceful signaling out of the AS boundaries, without the need to explicitly
                configure filters to strip the community off upon path propagation.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                By providing the g-shut service to a neighboring AS, an ISP provides
                means to this neighbor to lower the LOCAL_PREF value assigned to the paths
                received from this neighbor.
            </t>
            <t>
                The neighbor could abuse the technique and do inbound traffic
                engineering by declaring some prefixes as undergoing a maintenance so as to
                switch traffic to another peering link.
            </t>
            <t>
                If this behavior is not tolerated by the ISP, it SHOULD monitor the use
                of the g-shut community by this neighbor.
            </t>
            <t>
                ASes using the regular (transitive) g-shut community SHOULD remove the
                community from neighboring ASes that do not support the g-shut procedure.
                Doing so prevents malignant remote ASes from using the community through
                intermediate ASes that do not support the feature, in order to perform
                inbound traffic engineering. ASes using the non-transitive extended
                community do not need to do this as the community is non transitive and
                hence cannot be used by remote ASes.
